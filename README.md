## Project Description
Have you ever found yourself in a classroom or an office trying to concentrate on your work but can’t get rid of a song stuck in your head? Or maybe getting chills when you listen to a specific song? If not these, you would have definitely found yourself delving into memories of someone or something while listening to a particular song, What causes these phenomena? How does it work? Why does certain songs become popular?

In this project, I try to answer this and other similar phenomenons by analyzing music data from Spotify.  
I plan to apply statistical methods for descriptive analysis and create interactive visualization to convey the insights.

This is an ONGOING project, planned to be completed by end of December 2019.
I will be updating my progress periodically here.

To this date, I have successfully completed data extraction and cleaning part of the project.
Detailed explaination and procedures of the steps can be found in the respective file.
